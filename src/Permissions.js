/**
 * Chasi Bot v1.2.0
 * By ChaCha Si on 1/11/20
 *
 * Chasi Bot is a Multiplayer Piano Bot written for NodeJS. This
 * bot provides commands not frequently seen in MPP bots created from
 * 2012-2016. These commands include variables, permissions, and files.
 *
 * This is where the user permissions are set. This file works with the file
 * CommandManager.js so that users could access commands that are at their
 * access levels. This prevents regular users from accessing the owner commands
 * without permission.
