# ChasiBot
ChasiBot is a bot written by Green Tea on 1/11/2020. ChasiBot includes
a bot interface that makes it easier for bot programmers to create bots
in Multiplayer Piano. ChasiBot includes a chat buffer, permission manager,
and command manager. The bot's terminal is made to include specific data
such as the time when messages are logged, and a chat log that is saved when
the bot is exited.

To use this bot, download the repository, make sure that the dependencies are
installed, and run `node ChasiBot.js`. Feel free to adjust some of the settings
in the settings.txt file in the root directory.
